# Tower — the site

One self-contained landing page: `index.html`. All CSS and JS are inline, there
is no build step, and **no third-party origin is contacted** — the fonts are
served from this folder.

The radar and the four model marks are ported 1:1 from `src/Glyph.swift` /
`Tower Identity Study.html`, so the page animates the *real* identity rather than
a picture of it. Everything else on the page describes behavior that actually
ships — if the guard, the weather, usage, or the agent monitor change, the copy
here has to follow.

## What's in here

## Design notes

- **Dark instrument, not dark SaaS.** One flat panel primitive (`.well`,
  `--panel #08080a`, hairline borders). Glass (`backdrop-filter`) is spent in
  exactly **three** places — the nav, the popover replica, the final CTA. Adding
  a fourth is how this page drifted into looking generic the first time.
- **No card grids, no hover-lifts.** Sections are flat rows with hairline
  dividers — the same layout law the real popover follows (`docs/DESIGN.md`:
  "flat rows + dividers, Wi-Fi-menu style, no card chrome"). Hover brightens a
  hairline; it never floats a card.
- **Mono is the structural voice.** Every label, readout and annotation is
  JetBrains Mono — the same face the app bundles for its model/effort chips. The
  section name sits *on* the rule between bands (`.brule`), so no section needs a
  repeated kicker/eyebrow of its own.
- **Color is status, never decoration.** Green/amber/red/purple appear only where
  they carry the meaning they carry in the app. The tier accents
  (gold/rosso/steel/crayon) appear only on the model *labels*, never on a mark.
- **One loudest thing.** An `IntersectionObserver` keeps alive only the
  instruments that are on screen; everything else freezes, and the rAF loop stops
  entirely when the tab is hidden or nothing visible is animating. Reduce Motion
  freezes every mark at a legible still frame.

## Regenerating the assets

One-off asset steps, not a build step. Run from the repo root.

```bash
CHROME="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"

# og.png — 1200×630 social card
"$CHROME" --headless --disable-gpu --hide-scrollbars --force-device-scale-factor=1 \
  --virtual-time-budget=3000 --window-size=1200,630 \
  --screenshot="$PWD/site/og.png" "file://$PWD/site/og.html"

# apple-touch-icon.png — 180×180
"$CHROME" --headless --disable-gpu --hide-scrollbars --force-device-scale-factor=1 \
  --virtual-time-budget=2000 --window-size=180,180 \
  --screenshot="$PWD/site/apple-touch-icon.png" "file://$PWD/site/icon.html"
```

### The fonts

**Sans** is the system stack first (`-apple-system` → SF Pro), because that is
what the app itself renders in; **Inter** is self-hosted and only fetched where
SF Pro doesn't exist. **Mono** is JetBrains Mono, subset from the very TTFs the
app bundles.

```bash
# Inter — Google's own latin-subset variable woff2, saved locally
curl -o site/fonts/inter-latin.woff2 \
  "https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/inter/v20/UcC73FwrK3iLTeHuS_nVMrMxCp50SjIa1ZL7W0Q5nw.woff2"

# JetBrains Mono — subset from src/Fonts/*.ttf (needs `pip install fonttools brotli`)
UNI='U+0020-007E,U+00A0,U+00B7,U+00D7,U+2013,U+2014,U+2018,U+2019,U+201C,U+201D,U+2022,U+2026,U+2190-2193,U+2500-257F,U+2580-259F,U+25A0-25FF,U+2713,U+2717,U+26A0,U+26D4,U+00B0,U+25CF,U+25CB,U+21BB'
for W in Medium:500 Bold:700; do
  python3 -m fontTools.subset "src/Fonts/JetBrainsMono-${W%%:*}.ttf" \
    --unicodes="$UNI" --layout-features='kern,liga,calt' --flavor=woff2 \
    --output-file="site/fonts/jetbrainsmono-${W##*:}.woff2" --desubroutinize --no-hinting
done
```

The block glyphs (`█ ░ ▂▃▅▆`) are load-bearing — they draw the TUI replica's
usage bars and sparkline. Keep them in the subset range.

## Deploy

`.github/workflows/deploy-site.yml` fires on any push to `main` that touches
`site/**`. It copies `site/` to a temp dir, strips `README.md` / `og.html` /
`icon.html`, adds `.nojekyll`, and force-pushes an orphan commit to the
**`gh-pages`** branch. GitHub Pages is set to *Deploy from a branch →
`gh-pages` / root* — **not** "GitHub Actions" as the source. It can also be run
by hand from the Actions tab.

Live at `https://ghhrmnzdh.github.io/tower/`.

After a deploy:

```bash
git fetch origin && git ls-tree origin/gh-pages --name-only   # no README/og.html/icon.html
curl -sI https://ghhrmnzdh.github.io/tower/sitemap.xml
```

Then run the live URL through the Rich Results Test (both `SoftwareApplication`
and `FAQPage` should parse) and an OG debugger.

**One caveat about `robots.txt`:** crawlers only read it at the *origin root*
(`ghhrmnzdh.github.io/robots.txt`), which this repo doesn't control — so the copy
here is inert until Tower has a custom domain. Sitemap discovery comes from
submitting it in **Google Search Console** instead (URL-prefix property, verified
with a `google-site-verification` meta tag in `index.html`'s head).

## The download button

Every "Download Tower.app" points at `releases/latest`, which redirects to the
releases page while no release exists. To make it a real download:

```bash
./build.sh
ditto -c -k --keepParent Tower.app Tower.app.zip
gh release create v0.1.0 Tower.app.zip -t "Tower 0.1.0" -n "First public build."
```

## Editing

- **Tokens** are the `:root` block at the top of `index.html`.
- **The marks** are `radarSVG` / `drawRadar` / `modelSVG` / `drawModel` in the
  inline `<script>` — keep them in sync with `src/Glyph.swift` if the identity
  changes.
- **The FAQ** is mirrored into a `FAQPage` JSON-LD block, and the schema text
  must stay **identical** to the visible answer — a mismatch is a spam signal.
  Edit both, or neither.
